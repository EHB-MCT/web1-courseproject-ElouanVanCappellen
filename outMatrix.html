				<h2>The choice that changed my life</h2>
				<p class="self-introduction">
					hey offered me a choice: stay asleep in a world I thought was real, or
					wake up to the truth no matter how terrifying or uncertain it might
					be. I didn’t know where the red pill would take me, but deep down, I
					knew I couldn’t go back to pretending. That moment didn’t just change
					my life it reshaped my entire reality. It was the first time I truly
					chose to see the world outside of the matrix for what it was, not what
					it seemed to be.

					<h2>Choice and Free Will</h2>

					<p>
						When I learned the truth, everything I believed was real turned out
						to be a lie. The Matrix wasn’t the world—it was a prison. It made me
						question everything: what is real? I’ve come to understand that
						reality isn’t just what we see or touch; it’s what we believe.
						Inside the Matrix, the only limits are the ones we accept. Freedom
						starts in the mind, and when you let go of those limits, anything is
						possible.

					<h2>Reality and Perception</h2>

					<p>
						My life has been shaped by choices. The first was the hardest: the
						red pill or the blue pill. I chose truth, no matter how painful it
						was. People talk about fate, but I don’t believe the future is
						written. Every step I’ve taken has been my choice. Even when I
						sacrificed myself, it wasn’t because I had to—it was because I
						believed it was the right thing to do. Free will is about choosing
						and standing by those choices, no matter the cost.

					<h2>The machines</h2>
					<div class="white-rabbit">
						<img src="images/cool-shot.png" alt="machine invasion" />
					</div>
					<p>
						I once saw the Machines as the enemy, but they’re not driven by
						hatred they’re fighting to survive, just like us. Destroying them
						would mean destroying ourselves; Zion, our technology, even our
						survival depends on what they built. That’s why I chose peace. Not
						because I trust them, but because we need them as much as they need
						us. They’re not just a necessary evil—they’re part of the balance we
						have to accept if we’re ever going to move forward.
